# OriginCode's Typst Homework Template

A homework template for [Typst](https://typst.app/), inspired by [Adam Blank's Homework Template](https://www.countablethoughts.com/documents/homework-anon.tex) in $\LaTeX$ (sorry GitHub only allows me to display LaTeX in math mode).

## Usage

There are two main functions: `question` and `part`, which marks the corresponding sections.

There is also a helper function `indented` to create indented texts.

You can turn on question counter (e.g., "1. Question One") by set `disp_question_counter` variable in `template.typ` to `true`.
